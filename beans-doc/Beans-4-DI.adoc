==== DI

* _IoC_ : Inversion of Control
- normal : business logic calls lib
- IoC : framework calls business logic
* _DI_ : Dependency Injection
- normal : _dependency lookup_
- DI : framework manages (injects) dependencies
* Benefits of DI
- loose coupling -> easy to switch impl / test / modularize
* To use DI we supply the framework with a config
- This enables it to call business logic correctly.

=== Types of DI

* *CDI* (Constructor)
- _use:_ if provided & bound to instance
* *SDI* (Setter)
- can skip injections
- can swap injected ☕ without new instance of host ☕.
- _use:_ if optional or swappable
* *FDI* (Field, since 2.5 ~ `@Autowired`)

=== Ways to configure DI

* *XML*
** `beans.xml` -> `ParentBean`
*** CDI POJO
*** SDI method name pattern
** IDE may need plugin to validate XML configs
* *Java*
** `@Configuration AppConfig` -> `@Bean ParentBean`
*** CDI POJO
*** SDI POJO
** Config can be split into multiple `@Configuration` classes.
** Easier interaction with JUnit/Mockito
** Config classes must not be final (CGLib proxy)
* *Annotation*
** `@Configuration` : this is config
** `@ComponentScan(path)` : where to scan for components
** `@Component` : this is component
** `@Autowired` : inject this, used on
*** CDI `@Autowired`
*** SDI `@Autowired`
*** FDI `@Autowired`

=== @Import

* Import other `@Configuration`

=== @Qualifier

* used with @Autowire to distinguish bean instances of same type.
* differes based on 'way'
** B : 'qualifier' matches `@Bean qualifier()`
** C : 'qualifier' matches `@Component("qualifier")`
* can write own custome 'qualifiers' (skip due to scope, see https://www.baeldung.com/spring-autowire)

=== Trivia

* Annotation DI was added in Spring 2.5
* Annotation DI happens before XML, thus overriden if overlapping.

==== @Autowired

* If the type that is autowired is an `[]` or `Collection`, then the Spring container will collect all beans matching the value-type of the array in an array and inject the array.
* If type is `Map<String,Foo>`, spring will collect all and set Bean name as Key.
* can have any access modifier (incl.`private`)
* CDI `@Autowired` is only required if injected ☕ has multiple constructor.
* attributes:
- required : boolean (default: true )
** guess that thus all constructor params that are autowired are required
** this matches semantics where cdi obj are expected to be provided
