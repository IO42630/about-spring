* can use profiles on:
** @Configuration
** @Bean
** @Component
** type level in custom annotations (TODO?)

* one can set profile via `ConfigurableEnvironment`
** however, can't get it to initialize properly

* thus easy way to supply via VM params
* @Profile can be used on @Configuration or @Bean
